# accessibility-audit

Audit a component or page for accessibility violations against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria.

## When invoked

Use this skill when asked to check accessibility, run an a11y audit, or find WCAG issues — phrases like "accessibility audit", "a11y check on [component/page]", "check WCAG compliance", "is [X] accessible".

## What is already automated — read this before auditing anything

**Axe runs on every Storybook story and fails the build.** `.storybook/preview.ts` sets `a11y.test: 'error'`, so `npm run test` (and therefore CI and `npm run verify`) already enforces WCAG 2.1 AA across the whole library — and the same run executes any story `play` function, so behavior a story asserts (focus, dismissal, keyboard) is enforced too. Start by running it:

```bash
npm run test
```

If that is green, every violation axe can detect is already absent — and re-checking icon-only button names, label association, `role="dialog"` naming or ARIA parent/child relationships by hand is duplicated effort.

**This skill exists for the three things that gate does not cover:**

1. **Colour contrast — excluded from the automated gate entirely.** `color-contrast` is switched off in `.storybook/preview.ts` by a settled decision of Rob's. **Read that override's comment first**: it is the authoritative record of why, and the single place the details belong. Since the 2026-08-20 accessible-teal split the shipped pairs the rule used to fail all clear AA; the rule stays off because the action colour is a token consumers re-point to their own palettes, so the gate would be judging a value the system does not own. That makes contrast — every pair, everywhere — the manual auditor's job, and **the single highest-value thing to audit**: nothing else checks it. Never propose re-enabling the rule without asking Rob first.
2. **What axe cannot see.** Axe catches roughly a third of WCAG issues. It cannot tell whether alt text is *meaningful*, whether focus order makes sense, or whether a helper message *should* have been associated with its control. (Behavior a story's `play` function asserts *is* covered — `Dialog.stories.tsx` proves the modal focus trap, restore, and stacked Escape in CI — so the manual job is the overlays with no play coverage yet.) (Two such bugs once shipped undetected until a manual survey found them: Dropdown announced neither its helper text nor its error state. Both were since fixed by moving Dropdown onto `Field`, but it took the manual survey, not axe, to find them.)
3. **Website pages beyond the automated sample.** A page-level axe pass (`scripts/validate-website-a11y.mjs`, in `verify` and CI) now runs against the served site in both themes with the same rule set — but only over the route sample in `scripts/served-site.mjs`, at one desktop viewport. Full-site sweeps, mobile viewports, and any page outside that sample remain this skill's job.

Report a finding as **already-enforced** if `npm run test` or the page-level axe pass would have caught it; that tells the reader the gate is working rather than implying a gap.

## Instructions

1. **Determine scope.** Accept one of:
   - A component name (e.g. `Dropdown`) → audits `src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.tsx` and its CSS
   - A website page URL (e.g. `/components/button`) → audits the live rendered page
   - `all-components` → audits all components in `src/components/`

2. **Read the source files.** For each component in scope, read the `.tsx` and `.css` files before taking screenshots.

3. **Structural audit (from source code).** Most items here are already enforced by axe — spend your effort on the ones marked **[manual]**, which it cannot evaluate:

   **Semantic HTML & ARIA:**
   - Interactive elements use correct roles (`button`, `link`, `checkbox`, etc.) — never a `<div onClick>` without `role` and `tabIndex`
   - Icon-only `<button>` elements have `aria-label` describing their action
   - **[manual]** `<img>` elements have *meaningful* `alt` text — axe only checks that the attribute exists; decorative images use `alt=""`
   - Form inputs are associated with `<label>` via `htmlFor`/`id`, or have `aria-label`
   - Modals and dialogs use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`, with `aria-labelledby` pointing to the title
   - Lists use `<ul>`/`<ol>` + `<li>`, not `<div>` stacks
   - Heading hierarchy is logical — no h3 before h2, no skipped levels

   **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - **[manual]** All interactive elements are reachable by Tab, in an order that makes sense — axe cannot judge order
   - Custom interactive components handle `onKeyDown` for Enter/Space (buttons) and arrow keys (any component with roving or list focus — radio groups, segmented controls, listboxes, tablists)
   - **[manual where no `play` function covers it]** Modal/dialog *actually* traps focus while open and restores it to the trigger on close — axe sees the attributes, not the behaviour. The modal overlays share one behavior implementation (design.md's Components intro owns the contract), so a real trap/restore defect there is a finding against all of them, not one
   - Escape key closes dismissible overlays (any floating panel — tooltips, popovers, menus, dialogs, pickers)

   **Focus Styles:**
   - Every interactive element has a `:focus-visible` rule in its CSS
   - Focus ring uses the teal action token (`--color-action-primary-bg`) — design.md's teal rules are the authoritative list of sanctioned uses. Flag any `outline: none` without a visible replacement

   **Motion** (axe evaluates none of this):
   - **[manual]** Anything that animates for more than five seconds, or loops indefinitely, can be paused, stopped, or hidden (WCAG 2.2.2). CSS motion satisfies this through the reduced-motion block in `tokens-motion.css`, which carries two mechanisms and whose own header comment owns the contract: token collapse for token-consuming CSS, and a universal `*` guard that also covers hardcoded and `ds-allow(motion)`-sanctioned literal timings (an infinite loop on an off-scale duration is still guarded). Read it there rather than assuming which half applies
   - **[manual]** Animation driven from JavaScript is **outside that guard** — a `requestAnimationFrame` loop cannot be seen by CSS, so each one has to check `prefers-reduced-motion` itself. Enumerate the JS-side checks with a grep for `prefers-reduced-motion` across `src/components/**/*.tsx` and `website/src` — the grep is the inventory, not any list written here (the site's ambient background, which renders a single static frame under the preference, is one illustration; more exist and new ones keep arriving) — and confirm each still honours the preference rather than assuming the token layer covers it. That grep has one known blind spot: the recharts-backed charts animate their marks in from JavaScript but never contain the string — their guard is recharts' own `isAnimationActive: 'auto'` default, and design.md's chart-set spec owns the contract (a literal `true` would override the guard). Run a second grep for `isAnimationActive` across `src/components/` — a clean result means the default guard holds everywhere; any explicit override is a finding to check against that spec
   - **[manual]** Motion triggered by interaction (parallax, cursor-reactive effects) is disabled under reduced motion, or is not essential (WCAG 2.3.3)

4. **Visual audit (from screenshots).** Start the preview server and screenshot the target in both light and dark mode (follow the `visual-review` skill pattern). Check:
   - **Colour contrast (the priority — nothing automated covers this):** compute the ratio for every foreground/background pair actually rendered, not just body text. Flag anything below 4.5:1 for normal text or 3:1 for large text and UI components (WCAG 1.4.3 / 1.4.11). Note which token is used. Nothing is pre-exempt: the `color-contrast` axe rule is off for every pair (see Key context point 1), so every rendered pair is this audit's job; the shipped action pairings' AA clearance is recorded in that override's comment, so cross-check against it before flagging one of them.
   - **Text sizing:** No text visually below ~12px (WCAG 1.4.4)
   - **Focus visibility:** Confirm focus rings are clearly visible in both light and dark themes

   Stop the server when done.

5. **For each issue, report:**

   ```
   src/components/FilterMenu/FilterMenu.tsx:84 — WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value [Critical]
   Trigger button has no accessible name. Icon-only button needs aria-label="Open filters".
   ```

   (The example is fictional by design — `FilterMenu` is not a real component; it illustrates the report shape only.)

   Severity:
   - **Critical** — blocks keyboard or screen reader users entirely
   - **Moderate** — degrades experience significantly
   - **Minor** — best practice violation, low direct impact

6. **Summarise:**
   - `X critical · Y moderate · Z minor`
   - If clean: "No accessibility violations found. Component meets WCAG 2.1 AA."
