# drift-audit

Verify that every self-description in the repo — skills, docs, website prose — still matches how the repo actually works.

## When invoked

Use this skill after any structural or architectural change (a new build step, a moved directory, a changed dependency model, a new published surface), or when asked whether the docs and skills are still accurate — phrases like "run a drift audit", "are the docs up to date", "check for gaps".

## The governing idea

Build validators already catch everything *mechanically checkable*. This audit exists for the layer beneath them: **prose that asserts something about the system, and instructions that only fail when someone follows them.** A skill telling you to run a deleted npm script passes every validator and every build — it fails silently, months later, for whoever runs it.

**Do not trust this file's own description of the architecture.** It deliberately contains no *inventory* facts — no counts, paths, component lists, or versions, only the command entry points needed to derive them — because inventory facts would rot too. Derive the current shape from the sources of truth (package.json scripts, registries, the validator chain, the exports map) every time.

**Verify by executing, not by reading.** The most valuable findings come from actually running what a doc prescribes. Reading a worktree recipe looks fine; running it surfaces that the bundler now rejects it.

## Instructions

### 1. Establish the current reality first

Before judging any prose, build an accurate picture of what is true *right now*:

```bash
npm run validate-registry          # what the automated chain enforces, and what it prints
# The chain is not the whole automated layer: the `verify` entry in the root
# package.json ends with the validators that need built HTML and so run after
# the website build (in `verify` and CI), outside this chain.
node -e "console.log(Object.keys(require('./package.json').scripts).join('\n'))"
node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').exports, null, 2))"
git log --oneline -20
```

(Heads-up: `validate-registry` **writes** — its leading generator scripts regenerate the derived surfaces; the script entry in the root `package.json` is the authoritative list of what. Check `git status` before and after, so regenerated output isn't mistaken for a finding.)

Read the root `package.json` (scripts, dependency model, workspaces), the validator scripts named in `validate-registry`, and the recent commits. The recent commits tell you *what kind* of drift to hunt for — a dependency-model change implicates install instructions everywhere; a renamed route implicates nav, sitemap, and cross-links.

If `validate-registry` fails, stop and report that first — the automated layer is broken and everything downstream is unreliable.

### 2. Mechanical cross-checks

These are checkable by grep and should be exhaustive. For each, the question is "does the thing this text references still exist?"

- **Every command referenced in prose exists.** Collect `npm run <script>` mentions across `*.md`, `.claude/skills/**`, and `website/src/**`, and diff against the real script list. A referenced-but-missing script is a broken instruction. **Check every workspace's scripts, not just the root** — a mention may be workspace-scoped (`--workspace <name>`, or preceded by a `cd`), which a naive grep reports as missing when it is perfectly valid.
- **Every file path referenced in prose exists.** Extract path-looking strings from README.md, every root spec (the doc list in `scripts/validate-doc-refs.mjs` is the authoritative set — it includes tracked specs that are not published to /blueprints; `FILES` in `scripts/sync-blueprints.mjs` is only the published subset), and every SKILL.md, and test each one. Moved or deleted files leave dangling references. Expect noise and filter it before reporting: bare filenames used conversationally (`globals.css`), scaffolding placeholders (`ComponentName.tsx`, `my-component/page.tsx`), date placeholders (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`), and shorthand for a pair (`tokens-light/dark.css`) are all fine. Only a path that *claims* to point at something real and doesn't is a finding.
- **Every import specifier in docs matches the real exports map.** Any `import … from "…"` in documentation or example code should resolve against the package's current `exports` (or be an obvious third-party import). Renamed aliases and scopes hide here.
- **Internal links resolve.** Route strings in website prose (`/foundations/...`, `/playground`) should correspond to real app directories, and the nav config should agree.
- **Counts come from registries, never literals.** Grep displayed numbers near countable nouns; each should be an imported constant.
- **Config still applies where it is declared.** A restructure can leave a config block sitting somewhere the tool no longer reads, and nothing warns you — it just silently stops taking effect. Check that declared intent matches installed reality: dependency `overrides`/`resolutions` (npm honours these **only** in the workspace root), engine constraints, lint and TS config inheritance, and bundler aliases. For dependency pins specifically, compare the declared range against what is actually installed (`npm ls <pkg>`) and run `npm audit` — pins are usually security fixes, so one that stops applying is a silent regression, not a style issue.

### 3. Prose surfaces — read against reality

For each surface, the test is: *if a stranger followed this exactly, would it work, and would what they believe afterwards be true?*

- **README.md** — highest stakes: it ships inside the npm tarball, so its install and usage instructions reach every consumer. Verify the install command, import examples, customization recipes, and local-dev steps against the real package.
- **CLAUDE.md** — the project's operating manual: structure diagram, quick start, command list, registries/generated surfaces, architecture invariants, infrastructure facts. Every generated surface must be listed with its markers and its generator.
- **design.md** — design language claims and per-component specs. Check that stated invariants are still enforced and that specs match the components.
- **content-design.md** — the content style guide. Check that its Register by Surface table still lists every prose surface that exists, that its pointers at skill-owned standards still land, and that no rule in it duplicates one CLAUDE.md owns (fact-architecture rules live in CLAUDE.md, style rules here — a rule restated in both is drift).
- **Website self-descriptions** — any page that explains how the system is built (the overview/pipeline, get-started and docs pages, foundations pages). These are public claims; treat inaccuracy as a bug.
- **Other root specs** — any tracked root spec beyond the three above, published or not (the doc list in `scripts/validate-doc-refs.mjs` is the authoritative set; `FILES` in `scripts/sync-blueprints.mjs` lists only the ones published to /blueprints). Each makes claims about code it describes; spot-check its heavily-referenced facts the same way, and check that its published-vs-repo-only status is stated where readers would assume otherwise.
- **Blueprint copies** — if the repo publishes copies of its own docs, confirm they are generated rather than hand-maintained, and that they regenerated.
- **Statistical drift — the code outvotes the docs.** An agent (or a new contributor) learns the system from what is most *common* in the codebase, not from what the prose asserts: the most-used stray pattern outvotes the documented one, because prevalence reads as canon. For a few core conventions the docs state — tokens over raw values, the canonical component over ad-hoc rewrites, the published import paths — census actual usage and check that the dominant pattern is the sanctioned one. A convention can be drift even when every individual instance is legal, if an unsanctioned variant outnumbers the documented form; and when the census is mechanically repeatable, the fix to recommend is a validator (see Guardrails), not a docs edit. The same lens covers adoption: a surface the repo publishes but nothing consumes — a component no page or story renders, an export subpath nothing imports — is a public claim the numbers contradict; judge whether it is merely early or actually dead, and say which.

### 4. Skills self-audit — the highest-yield section

Read **every** `SKILL.md`, not just the ones that seem related. For each, ask:

- Does every command it prescribes still exist and still do what it claims?
- Does every path it references still exist?
- Does it describe a workflow that a tooling change has since broken? **Where a skill scripts a multi-step recipe (worktrees, builds, deploys), actually execute it in a throwaway location and confirm it completes.** Clean up afterwards.
- Does it tell the reader to hand-edit something that has since become generated?
- Does it describe one-time setup that is now complete, or a future state that has since arrived?
- Does its section/category list omit anything added since it was written?
- Does it duplicate a fact that lives in a registry — or in a doc that owns it (design.md, CLAUDE.md, content-design.md) — instead of pointing at that home?

Then check for **missing coverage**: is there now a repeated, consequential workflow with no skill? Recent commits are the evidence — a ritual performed manually twice is a skill-shaped hole, especially where mistakes are expensive or irreversible.

### 5. Consumer and privacy surfaces

- **What ships externally.** If the repo publishes a package, inspect the built artifact — its manifest, its file list, its size, and the docs inside it. Personal data hides in doc comments that become type declarations.
- **No secrets or personal data in public surfaces.** Sweep tracked files and the built artifact for credential-shaped strings, private emails, tokens, keys, and absolute local paths. Distinguish deliberately-public identifiers (an analytics measurement ID visible in page source by design) from genuine leaks, and say which is which rather than crying wolf.

### 6. Report

Group by severity, most actionable first. Every finding needs a file path (with line number where it applies), what it currently says, why that is wrong now, and the fix.

```
## Drift Audit

### Broken — following this would fail
- path/to/SKILL.md:42 — prescribes `npm run <deleted-script>`; replaced by X in <commit>

### Stale — inaccurate, would mislead
- CLAUDE.md:88 — structure diagram still lists a deleted directory

### Gaps — missing coverage
- No skill covers <repeated consequential workflow>

### Verified accurate
- <surfaces checked and found correct — say so explicitly, so the reader knows the scope>

### Summary
X broken · Y stale · Z gaps · N surfaces verified
```

State plainly what you **executed** versus what you only **read** — an unverified pass is weaker evidence, and the reader deserves to know which they are getting.

Then ask whether to apply the fixes. Do not fix silently as you go: the report is the deliverable, and some findings are judgement calls (a "gap" may be deliberate scope).

## Guardrails

- Never edit generated files to resolve a finding — fix the generator or its source, then regenerate
- Never weaken a validator to make a finding disappear
- If a finding is mechanically checkable and keeps recurring, the real fix is a **new validator in the `validate-registry` chain**, not a docs edit — recommend that explicitly (this repo's convention: anything countable or checkable gets build-enforced so it can never drift again)
- Report honestly when a surface was skipped or a check was inconclusive; silence reads as "verified"
