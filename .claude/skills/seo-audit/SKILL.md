# seo-audit

A recurring optimizer sweep over the website's technical SEO: each run inspects everything a crawler or link unfurler sees, fixes what is safely fixable on a local branch, and reports for approval. **A run that finds nothing to fix is a valid outcome** — say so briefly and stop; never invent a change to have something to ship.

## When invoked

Run when asked to "run the SEO audit" (`/seo-audit`).

## Scope guardrails (read first)

- **Behind the scenes only.** Head metadata, crawl/index surfaces, link unfurl tags, structured data, redirects, internal-link integrity. Nothing a sighted visitor sees changes: no layout, no CSS, no component structure, no visible copy. (Meta titles and descriptions are in scope — they render in search results, not on the page.)
- **Crawl-policy changes are report-only.** Anything that changes what gets indexed or where the canonical site lives (robots rules, `noindex`, canonical host, redirect policy) gets proposed in the report, not implemented — unless it is an outright bug, like a page accidentally marked `noindex`.
- **Local branch only.** Never push, merge, or deploy; never touch the user's working tree. Do the work in a temporary git worktree on a fresh branch named `seo/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`, and remove the worktree when done (the branch survives). Skip the worktree entirely on a clean pass.
- **No hardcoded facts.** New metadata prose follows `content-design.md`; anything countable derives from a registry (see CLAUDE.md — never write a component count into a meta description).

## The sweep

### 1. Inventory the surfaces

The crawl/index surface lives in `website/src/app/`: the root `layout.tsx` (site-wide metadata and `metadataBase`), `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, `manifest.ts`, `opengraph-image.tsx`, `icon.tsx` and `apple-icon.tsx`, and the `llms.txt` route — plus the structured data the layout injects, built in `website/src/lib/structuredData.ts` (its `sameAs` derives from `website/src/config/social.ts`). Per-page metadata comes from each page's `layout.tsx`; component pages derive theirs from the registry via `componentPageMetadata`. Read these fresh each run — the list above says where to look, not what is there.

### 2. Verify the rendered output, not the source

Build the site (`npm run build` in `website/`), then serve it via the `website-prod` entry in `.claude/launch.json` — it wraps `npm run start` and takes any assigned port, so it never collides with a running dev server; read the port from what it reports. Then fetch the served HTML — plain HTTP requests are enough; no browser needed. Sample every section of the site (at least one page per top-level route group, plus the home page and one component page), and fetch the sitemap, robots, and manifest routes directly. For each sampled page check the `<head>`:

- Title present, unique across pages, and following the site's title template.
- Meta description present, sensible length (~70–160 characters), and specific to the page.
- Canonical URL correct — one canonical host, no duplicate-content splits.
- Open Graph and Twitter card tags complete enough for a clean unfurl (title, description, image, type, url).
- No accidental `noindex`/`nofollow`; viewport and charset present.
- Structured data (JSON-LD) valid where present; note opportunities where a page type clearly warrants it.

### 3. Cross-check the crawl graph

- Every public route appears in the sitemap, and every sitemap URL returns 200 from the running server. Registry-driven collections (components from the registry, template screens from `templatesSidebarLinks` in `website/src/config/navigation.ts`) must be complete in it — if one is missing, the fix belongs in how `sitemap.ts` derives the list, not in a hand-added entry. Nav-linked does not imply sitemap-listed: a deliberately noindex page may sit in the nav (its own metadata comment is the record of that decision), and it stays out of the sitemap by design.
- Robots rules and the sitemap agree (nothing disallowed that the sitemap advertises).
- Internal links resolve: no anchors pointing at routes that 404. (Largely already automated: `scripts/validate-internal-links.mjs` enforces this on every build for prerendered hrefs — spend the crawl on what it cannot see: external links, redirect chains, and the live HTTP status of anything client-rendered.)
- The 404 page itself returns HTTP 404, not 200.

### 4. Fix, verify, hand off

Apply the mechanical, clearly-safe fixes in one coherent batch on the branch; leave judgment calls (crawl policy, new structured-data strategy, description rewrites that change meaning) as proposals in the report. Do not build in the worktree: a fresh one has no `node_modules`, so the prebuild chain fails (the corpus generator needs `typescript`), and installing there is what `land` forbids. Commit the batch on the branch and remove the worktree (the branch survives); the build check happens when the branch is landed, whose combined `npm run verify` builds it. Metadata edits are page prose, so that build regenerates the site chat's corpus (`website/src/data/site-corpus.generated.ts`), and the regenerated file is committed with the landing.

Where a finding is deliberately not a bug — a page intentionally out of the sitemap, an intentionally bare head — record why in a short comment at the site of the decision, so future runs read the reason instead of re-flagging it.

### 5. Report

Repeat the full report in the final message (no report file — the in-place comments from step 4 are the durable record). Plain English, findings grouped as **fixed on the branch** (with before → after), **proposed** (needs a decision), and **checked clean** (what was verified and passed). End with the branch name if one exists, confirmation the build passed, and the reminder that nothing is pushed or deployed: merging the branch (or saying `ship`) approves it; deleting it rejects it.
