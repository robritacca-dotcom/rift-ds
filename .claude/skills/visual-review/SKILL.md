# visual-review

Start the website dev server and screenshot pages in both light and dark mode, at desktop and mobile widths, to catch visual issues.

## When invoked

Use this skill when asked to visually review changes — phrases like "check how this looks", "review light and dark", "does this look right", "screenshot the page", "visual check".

This skill catches what is **broken** — clipped text, invisible elements, layout collapse. For whether something is **good** — craft, consistency, polish, taste — use the `design-qa` skill instead.

## Instructions

Use the browser/preview tools available in the current environment for every step below — this skill describes *what* to do; map it to whatever tools the harness currently provides. Never launch the dev server through a raw shell command.

1. **Determine which URLs to review.** If not specified, default to the page(s) most recently modified in the current conversation. Ask if unclear.

2. **Open the website's Next.js dev server** (the `website` configuration in `.claude/launch.json`; port 3000 by default, but the config sets `autoPort`, so read the URL the preview actually reports rather than assuming 3000) in the browser preview and wait for it to be ready.

3. **For each URL, check both themes at both viewports.** The rendered theme is the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. To switch: click the theme toggle in the top nav (`MegaNav`, top-right) — the explicit Light or Dark segment, not System — or set both `data-theme` and `data-theme-setting` programmatically (the only route on the chromeless stage pages, which render no nav). While `data-theme-setting` is `system` (the default on a fresh profile), the theme follows the browser's colour scheme live, so forcing `data-theme` alone can be overridden mid-review by an OS theme change. Verify the attribute actually changed before screenshotting, then take a screenshot in each theme. Repeat at a mobile viewport (~375px wide — mobile is a first-class surface: type and spacing collapse at the token layer, and navigation moves into a drawer): screenshot both themes there too, and on at least one page open the drawer nav, expand a section, and screenshot it open. The site chat has three geometries and the default desktop width shows the least interesting one: a full-viewport takeover with its own stacked welcome screen on phones, a floating modal panel at mid widths, and a docked panel that insets the whole page beside it at the widest (design.md's SiteChat panel spec owns the exact breakpoints). On at least one page, open the chat at the mobile width and at a desktop width wide enough to dock, and screenshot both — the docked form is the one that moves the page, so a layout that survives a mid width can still break there.

4. **Examine each screenshot for:**
   - Text that is invisible or the same colour as its background
   - Components that appear broken, overflow their container, or clip
   - Spacing that looks inconsistent or misaligned compared to other pages
   - Hover/focus states that appear stuck in an active state
   - Images or assets that failed to load (broken image icons)
   - Any layout that differs unexpectedly between light and dark
   - At mobile width: horizontal overflow (a page that scrolls sideways), content clipped by the viewport, and drawer navigation that fails to open, scroll, or close

5. **Report findings** concisely:
   - Format: `[URL] [dark|light] [desktop|mobile] — description of issue`
   - If no issues found, say: `[URL] — looks correct in both themes at both widths`

6. **Stop the preview server** when all pages are reviewed, unless the session is still using it.

## Key context

- Theme state lives on `document.documentElement`: `data-theme-setting` is the visitor's choice (`system`, `light` or `dark`) and `data-theme` is what it resolves to (`light` or `dark`) — every style reads the latter. The choice persists via the localStorage key `theme` and both attributes are applied before first paint by an inline script in the root layout, which also keeps a `system` setting following the OS
- The theme toggle is rendered by `MegaNav`, which pages mount themselves — the chromeless stage routes (`CHROMELESS_ROUTES` in `website/src/config/chromeless.ts`, `/graph` included) render no nav and so no toggle; switch themes there programmatically via the attribute route in step 3
- The sitemap footer (`SiteFooter`), the chat button/panel, and the site-wide command palette (`SitePalette`, opened from the header's search button or Cmd+K, so invisible in a static screenshot until triggered) are site chrome mounted once from the root layout, not per page — expect the first two in every screenshot's lower region (the chat as a floating button when closed; open, it is a takeover on phones, a modal panel on mid widths, and a docked panel at the widest that pads the page to make room — see step 3). Hovering the closed chat button opens its per-page AI-summary panel (a frosted TLDR card with prompt chips, fed from the page-summaries registry) — expected chrome, not a stray overlay, so a pointer resting near the bottom-right corner can legitimately summon it mid-capture. Deliberately hover it on at least one page per theme and let the reveal settle (the think beat plus the typed reveal take a few seconds; the constants in `src/tokens/motion.ts` are the timings) before capturing, since no automated gate sees that panel render. The chat panel itself animates open and closed: a capture right after opening catches it low and part-transparent mid-entrance, and one right after a close catches the still-mounted dying panel — both are the animation, not a layout bug or a stuck overlay; let it settle before capturing. The welcome starters and a fresh answer's follow-up chips also stage a shimmer-then-pop reveal (design.md's Site chat pattern owns the choreography), so shimmer pills where chips belong are a loading state, not missing content. On the mobile pass, check the footer's collapse against design.md's Site footer pattern (it owns the column ladder): the brand block leaves the row and sits above the links at the same breakpoint the page's nav rail disappears at. The footer is identical on every page, so a difference between two pages is a finding; the brand block's width matching the rail is deliberate, not a coincidence to report
- The routes in `CHROMELESS_ROUTES` (`website/src/config/chromeless.ts`) deliberately render none of the shared chrome — footer, chat, and command palette — so their absence there is not a finding
- Nav items flagged `desktopOnly` in `website/src/config/navigation.ts` (the flags there are the authoritative list) disappear below 960px from every surface that renders at all widths — the footer's Design system column, the DS landing hero, the home DS card — and never appear in the mobile drawer. A link present at desktop and gone on the mobile pass is that flag working, not a finding. The pages behind those flags need a pointer and a wide viewport, so a ~375px screenshot of the page itself proves nothing either way
- The `animate-in` class on page elements triggers CSS entry animations — these are normal on first load
- The ambient background (`BlurBackground`) is layout-mounted chrome too, and it is the largest thing in every screenshot. Three of its behaviours produce **false findings** if you do not expect them:
  - **It has two renderers.** A WebGL2 field normally, the CSS blobs underneath as the fallback. Which one you capture depends on the machine's GPU, so the same page can legitimately screenshot two different ways on two runs. A background that differs between runs is not a finding; a *broken-looking* one is.
  - **There is a moment with no background at all.** While the renderer resolves, the blobs are hidden and the canvas has not faded in. A screenshot caught in those first frames shows bare page floor. Let the page settle before capturing.
  - **Most pages get a fixed-height band, not a full screen (CLAUDE.md's BlurBackground entry owns the modes and the number) — and the immersive stages get no ambient background at all.** Pages rendering `FullBleedBackground` fill the viewport; pages rendering `HiddenBackground` (beside `DotBackground`, the dotted stage ground) hide the ambient layer entirely, by design — a dotted stage with no glow is that mode working, not a missing background. Grep `FullBleedBackground` and `HiddenBackground` under `website/src/app` for the current sets rather than trusting a list here. Judge each page against its own variant.
- To rule the background in or out of a finding, `?tune=1` on any page in dev opens its control panel, which reports the live renderer and lets you A/B the shader against the CSS blobs
